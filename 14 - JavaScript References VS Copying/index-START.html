    // ANSWER: javascript has a garbage collector, 
    // it only collect those variable whose have no reference any more.

    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const myPlayers = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    myPlayers.push('Jireh');
    // now here is the problem!
    myLog(players, myPlayers);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
